      <p>You get to pick an asset every month to stick your name and a link next to permanently. To do this, we work with a system of "tokens".</p>
      <p>Each month, as soon as your payment is processed by Patreon, you receive one <strong>Sponsor Token</strong>. There are two ways to spend this token:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>By visiting the page of the asset you want to sponsor, and clicking the "Sponsor this asset" button on the right side of the page.</li>
        <li>Or you can turn on <em>Automatic Sponsorships</em> below, which will automatically pick a random asset for you on the 5th day of each month.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you want to be notified when you receive a new token, or when an asset is automatically picked for you, please enter your email address below: TODO</p>
      <p>TODO: Edit display name and link.</p>
